# python-api-challenge

# This project is an assignment by Andrew Belfiglio in the Data Science and Data Visualizations bootcamp at the University of Pennsylvania in collaboration with edX.

# This repository contains the WeatherPy challenge. 

# Within the WeatherPy folder, the WeatherPy.ipynb file generates random geographic coordinates and then finds the nearest city. This list of cities is used to query and parse the local weather from the OpenWeatherMap API. The resulting dataframe zipped to an output csv file and is also used to assess relationships between latitude and temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed.

# The VacationPy.ipynb file reads in the output csv file generated by the WeatherPy.ipynb script. The dataframe of cities and their weather is narrowed down to ideal vacation conditions, the nearest hotel is found using the Geoapify API, and the results are mapped.

# This code is original and is based on the curriculum of the bootcamp program.
